# ABOUT REPLS

These are small files that i created for testing the libraries and plugins of javascript.

**Remember** : They play no role in the how the code works , they are just for testing and learning purpose.

If you want to test a library or plugin , just create a repl in the format

[library_name].repl.js
example : `v8n.repl.js`
